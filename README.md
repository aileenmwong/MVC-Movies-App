# Independent practice: make a (almost) full CRUD movies express app.


### You will be working with a partner for this exercise.
 Remember how pair programming works? Ok, we can remind you: One person is a driver and another person in a navigator. It means that one person tells the other what to type and then they switch! It's common practice in many companies, so we want you go get more practice with it!

### First things first!
Inspect ALL the files that you are given in this repository! There are some comments-hints that will help you navigate the process along the way.


### This exercise will prepare you to create a fullstack application (almost) from SCRATCH! Whop! Whop!

> This IS a challenging exercise! It's okay if you get lost (we are here to support).


#### Suggestion:
**It's very important to keep track of what you're naming the files and where you put them. Then what you `export` things as and what you `require` them as, i.e. making sure the names match up. That's one goal of this lab, to get practice with exporting and requiring. It's fine if you don't get the app working. This is your first attempt!**

**Warning**: for the following steps you'll need to create the directories (routes, models, controllers) and the files (for the routes, controller, and model), refer to the quotes app!

3. Get the basic routes down for viewing all movies. Then try to get the controller part of that puzzle in place, and finally flesh out the model. And make sure to complete the corresponding view. When you navigate to `/movies`, it displays **all** movies.

4. Then, get to the route, view, controller, and model worked out for viewing a **single** movie.

5. Work out the route, view, controller, and model for **adding** a movie.

6. Now, get to DELETE: you know the drill! Route, view, controller, model!

7. If you get here, good job! Now you can do some styling, some hacking, whatever you'd like to try.

**this lab is tough, refer often to how we did things with the quotes app; TYPE EVERYTHING OUT and COMMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE. Be careful of what you're naming things so that you refer to the right names later on**
